CREDITS

Thanks a lot to all users who donated to the project! I never expected to 
receive a single donation. But as it turns out, quite a few people seem 
to use and like RED :-) 


Special thanks go to:

  * Wolf from the Computer Club Sunland Village (Mesa Arizona) 
    for his continuous kind feedback and beta testing!

  * Havy A.C. (ZyntaXis) for helping me with the Windows 7 
    and Vista compatibility

  * Russ for his idea of protecting and unprotecting directories

  * All other users who send me their feedback!



DISCLAIMER

To be honest with you as user of RED I have to tell you that one user of RED 
(v2.1) reported that it deleted folders which were not completely empty and 
contained files important to him. I'm really very sorry for that! I checked all
routines of RED several times to ensure nothing goes wrong, but somehow it 
happened on the system of that user. Unfortunately, I could not determine what
caused that behaviour. In addition to that the user did not wanted to try to
locate the error, because he was (understandably) very upsetand uninstalled RED 
instantly. But he told me that the directory names contained chinese characters. 
So I tried to reproduce the error by testing RED with foreign directory names. 
But I could not find a bug - RED worked as expected.

My conclusion: I currently assume it was a unfortunate exception or some sort
of misconfiguration and I hope that it does not happen again. I also refactored
and optimized the whole sourcecode of RED 2.2 to improve the stability and the
error handling.

To sum up, if you use RED for the first time have a look at the directories 
RED found and rethink if they are plausible. And if you want to be really 
safe double-click a few folders to see if they are really empty. This 
especially applies to systems with directory names containing any special 
characters. Contact me if you notice anything strange.

(BTW: As I originally developed RED for myself therefore I took particular 
care to ensure everything works correctly.)



HINTS & FAQ

  * Right click on a directory in the tree to get more options.
  
  * You can use Regular expressions (Regex) in the "Ignore these 
    files" filter lists by putting the filter between two slashes.
    Example: 
    
        /^tmp\.[0-9]+/ 
        The line above matches all files like tmp.001, tmp.002 etc.

  * Why am I getting these annoying "cannot access file" or 
    "Access to ... is denied." errors? -> That means RED tried to
    scan or delete a file or directory that was locked by another 
    application. This is a safety feature to ensure that programs
    don't access files that are currently opened by another.
    To fix this problem close all other programs before using RED. 
    If that does not help you could try using tools such as
    Unlocker (http://cedrick.collomb.perso.sfr.fr/unlocker/).

  * Why .NET Framework!?
    I'm sorry that RED requires the .NET Framework (the "Java" of 
    Microsoft) - it's really bloated. Regrettably, by now I did not had 
    the time to learn a "mature" programming language like C++.
    But since today every new Windows system comes with .NET preinstalled 
    it should not be that big problem...
