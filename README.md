## Description
This project was developed for my Introduction to Game Industry class (CPSC-242) at Chapman University. The goal of the project was to create a simple 3D game using the Unity game engine and use Blender to create the models and textures. I decided to create a simple 3D platformer game where the player controls a pill with limited maneuverability. The player must navigate the level and reach the end to win. Models, user interface, and music were created by myself.

## Installation
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/cwchilvers/Poppin-Pills/releases) and download the `Poppin.Pills.zip` file.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Run the `Poppin' Pills.exe` file.

## Usage
- Use the W key to move forward
- Press the spacebar to jump
- Left click and drag to rotate the camera
- Get to the end of the level to win
